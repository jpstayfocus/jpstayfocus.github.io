## Roles I'm Qualified for...

### Full Stack Software Engineer and Cybersecurity Evangelist 

I specialize in full stack software engineering with strong experience in both frontend and backend development using Node.js, Django, and React. I focus on writing code that is secure, maintainable, and highly performant. I’ve deployed scalable applications to AWS and Azure using GitHub Actions, and I’m proficient with Docker, CI/CD, and microservice architectures.

My cybersecurity expertise complements my engineering skills. I work extensively with Microsoft’s security ecosystem, including:

Microsoft Sentinel – for building automated incident detection, response, and correlation rules using KQL (Kusto Query Language), and integrating with Defender XDR for unified security operations.

Microsoft Purview – for data governance, sensitivity labeling, and compliance automation, ensuring that confidential data is protected and auditable across cloud and on-prem environments.

Azure Network Security – designing secure network topologies with Network Security Groups (NSGs), firewalls, and private endpoints, applying Zero Trust principles and least privilege access to minimize attack surfaces.

Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) – managing role-based access control (RBAC), conditional access, and Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce identity security at scale.

I apply DevSecOps practices across my development pipelines—embedding static code analysis, dependency scanning, and secret detection into CI/CD workflows. I regularly use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Defender for Cloud to harden applications and ensure compliance with ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and GDPR frameworks.

As a Cybersecurity Evangelist, my goal is to bridge the gap between development and defense—advocating for secure-by-design principles, proactive threat hunting, and continuous risk mitigation across the software lifecycle.

### Protocol Engineer

I'm experienced in building distributed systems using C++, Go, and Rust. With a passion for decentralization I would be a solid addition to a protocol engineering team. With a background in blockchain and zero knowledge proofs I can confidently build protocols or private dApps.

### DinkyLinky URL Shortener

A fun project I have been working on is a URL shortener. This shows hands on experience with system design topics, URL redirection, analytics, and deploying applications to the cloud.

### Course CMS

Official name to be released soon, I am building a content management system and learning platform for creators to QUICKLY release courses without the complexity introduced by other course platforms. The backend is being built with Rust (Axum) and the frontend is being built with React.

## Prior Projects

### Real-Time Security Data Platform

I designed and built a real-time security data platform that ingested and processed large volumes of event telemetry from multiple systems, delivering instant visibility through interactive dashboards and APIs. The backend—developed in Rust—was optimized for secure, low-latency data streaming, API scalability, and fault-tolerant performance.

The platform consumed logs and alerts from various sources, normalized them into structured formats, and transmitted them via WebSockets to frontend dashboards for live monitoring. This architecture provided continuous insights into system health, security posture, and threat detection trends.

I implemented robust authentication and encryption, OpenAPI documentation, and a DevSecOps pipeline with automated testing, container image scanning, and deployment validation. Data outputs were integrated with Microsoft Sentinel and Power BI, transforming raw telemetry into actionable analytics for security operations and compliance reporting.


### Cybersecurity Automation Project

During my cybersecurity internship at Hydro-Québec, I developed an automation framework to optimize certificate management workflows across enterprise systems. The solution integrated Venafi, Ansible, and PowerShell, with YAML-based playbooks orchestrating certificate issuance, renewal, and compliance validation.

Using Python, I created scripts to interact with the Venafi Trust Protection Platform (TPP) API—automating certificate discovery, metadata synchronization, and renewal tasks. The automation reduced manual workload, eliminated redundant approvals, and ensured alignment with internal PKI governance standards.

I also contributed to the creation of Power BI dashboards that visualized certificate lifecycle data and audit metrics from Microsoft Defender and Purview, providing the cybersecurity team with actionable insights into certificate health, system coverage, and compliance posture.

This project demonstrated the power of combining infrastructure automation, secure scripting, and data visualization to improve operational security efficiency at scale.

## My Skills Include...

### Web Development

I have experience in most major backend languages and frameworks including **Node.js**, **ASP.NET**, **Django**, and **Flask**. For frontend, I know **React**, **Typescript**, and the essentials of **CSS**.

I have a good understanding of Databases (**SQL** and **NoSQL**) and I'm comfortable building an **API**s with authorization and clear Open API specifications. I can create login systems in **React** and deploy everything to production on **AWS** with Docker and CI/CD.

### Collaboration

I am able to build software in a team environment with **GitHub**, branches, and pull requests. This includes open source software such as [this portfolio website](https://jpstayfocus.github.io/) built with **Jeckyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Additionally, I have a good understanding of **Markdown** and technical documentation engines such as **Docusaurus** and **GitBook**. I find it very important to build well documented and maintainable software.

I am familiar with Agile and comfortable working in a team environment with other highly motivated engineers.
